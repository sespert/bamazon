# BAMAZON APP

This is an Amazon-like storefront, where customers make orders and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app also gives access to a manager, so he/she can update the inventory or add more products.

## Key Elements and Features

- The app connects to a MySQL database and shows the table with all products in stock.
- User can interact with this database thru Node.js and make changes.


## Customer view

First, all the products in stock is showed to the customer. Next, the customer chooses which item to buy and how many of it. Once this is done, the final price of the sale is shown and the database is updated, substracting the items the customer just bought.

## Manager view

A manager can handle the inventory, by viewing it, checking which items have low stock, add more units of a product or add a new product.
